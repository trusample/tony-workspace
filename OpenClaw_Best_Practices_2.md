# OpenClaw Best Practices: 50+ Tips

Your OpenClaw workflows are about to get 10x better. Over the past three months, I've consumed 100+ pieces of content breaking down OpenClaw (videos, articles, courses, guides - all of it). Here's every tip worth knowing - compiled into one place. Save this so you don't lose it. No fluff, pure alpha. Let's get into it.

## Foundational Tips
50. **Pre-OpenClaw tip** - Before even touching OpenClaw, learn these skills:
   - Prompt engineering (learn to communicate with AI)
   - AI creativity (learn to use AI creatively, not just as a chatbot)
   - Agentic tools - use other agentic tools before touching OpenClaw (n8n, Manus, Zapier), this is how you learn what you can actually automate with OpenClaw

49. **Scope > execution** - Always explicitly limit directories and editable files to prevent unnecessary scans and risky modifications.

48. **Planning > execution** - Force it to propose a plan first, then approve before allowing file changes.

47. **Think in workflows, not one-off tasks** - OpenClaw delivers leverage when you chain repeatable processes, not isolated commands. Think: how can I turn this into a repeatable workflow?

46. **Cool prompt to use (iteration)**: "Every day, I want you to work on your own to iterate and improve. Surprise me daily [insert time] with a new task/project you completed to improve my pre-existing workflows."

45. **Model selection tips:**
   - Use lighter, faster models for simple refactors or file navigation, and reserve larger reasoning models for architecture decisions, debugging complex logic, or multi-step planning.
   - High-capability reasoning models are significantly more expensive than lightweight models, especially when processing large context windows or scanning multiple files, so match model power to task complexity to avoid unnecessary API burn. Opus 4.6 = heavy coding tasks, warm personality (more expensive). Mini Max = light daily tasks, good cheaper option.

43. **Hardware tips:** Prioritize RAM over raw CPU speed. OpenClaw workflows can spike memory usage when handling large repos or logs, so higher RAM prevents slowdowns and crashes. Use SSD storage, not HDD. Fast read/write speeds significantly improve file scanning, indexing, and repo-wide operations.

42. **Prompt templates** - standardize your prompt templates. Create reusable templates for refactoring, debugging, audits, and feature development, so your outputs remain consistent and predictable across projects. (Notion works well for this - connect your agent to a new Notion database)

41. **Optimal prompting structure** - Use a 5-part prompting structure: Structure every serious task as: Objective → Context → Constraints → Plan → Output format

## Best Practices
40. **Full Autonomy** - If you want 'fire-and-forget' autonomy, the biggest unlock is treating chat history as a cache, not the source of truth. Make state + artifacts the source of truth, and design the agent loop to always reconstruct 'what to do next' from disk (or a tiny structured store) after any compaction/reset.

39. **The two-phone setup**

38. **Give the agent a workspace (AGENTS)** - OpenClaw reads operating instructions and 'memory' from its workspace directory. By default, OpenClaw uses ~/.openclaw/workspace as the agent workspace, and will create it (plus starter AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md) automatically on setup/first agent run.

## Security & Privacy
20. **Private by default** - Keep OpenClaw private by default to prevent unnecessary exposure and reduce the risk of turning your AI agent into an attack surface. Start by limiting how OpenClaw can be reached. Bind it to localhost to ensure that only your own system can communicate with it. Second, expand access only when there is a defined operational need. Only allow connections you understand and expect, and expand access gradually when you have a clear reason to do so.

19. **Separate device** - Keep OpenClaw on a sandboxed device that doesn't contain your sensitive data (I recommend buying a separate Mac Mini).

18. **Security tips:** security tips  
17. **Security tips (from the creator)** - Peter Steinberger 🦞 @steipete · Jan 24 Replying to @hznus @openclaw and @AlexFinn Guardrails: - enable sandbox - enable white-list if you want to run commands out of it - read security doc - use model that has best-what-we-have prompt inject defense - run clawdbot security audit - don't add it to group chats if it is your personal bot.

16. **Treat skills as malicious by default** - Treat every third-party or community skill as untrusted until you verify its behavior.

15. **Non-admin user** - Run OpenClaw under a dedicated non-admin user to prevent system-wide damage.

14. **Official Security Docs:** https://docs.molt.bot/gateway/security
13. **Local > VPS** - Run locally versus a third-party service (better for model capabilities as well).

## Top 10 Tips
10. **Command cheatsheet:** command cheatsheet
9. **Memory tip:** Cole Bemis @colebemis · Jan 25 Pro tip: You can use @lumen_notes as a memory manager for @openclaw I asked my clawdbot to make its workspace a git repo and push to GitHub whenever it updates its memory files Now I can open that repo in Lumen to browse and edit memory files with a nice UI.
8. **AWS setup tips:** AWS setup tips
7. **Set Persona** - Explicitly tell your agent how you want it to speak, act, write, etc. (tone, style) Tip: use ElevenLabs text-to-speech (TTS).
6. **Web search tip** - Brave and Tavily These are both free. Brave is great for general searching, and Tavily is great for more specific use cases like scraping contacts, etc.
5. **Memory tip** - Openclaw forgets what you are talking about mid-sentence. Unlike ChatGPT, which tells you it's out of context, Clawdbot will just automatically compact and forget as you go along - this can be hugely frustrating for the uninitiated. Run this prompt - it sets you on the right path outside of the defaults to help with your memory management: "Enable memory flush before compaction and session memory search in my Clawdbot config. Set compaction.memoryFlush.enabled to true and set memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory to true with sources including both memory and sessions. Apply the config changes."
4. **Real use-cases for OpenClaw (for anyone):**
   - Morning brief
   - Personal research assistant
   - Email/calendar manager
   - Vibe coder (build any app you want)
   - Connect to Notion for easy database access
   - Second brain
3. **Heartbeat.md** - Keep HEARTBEAT.md lean. The Heartbeat.md file in OpenClaw is a crucial config file that defines a recurring checklist of tasks for an AI agent to perform autonomously (runs every 30M). Keep it small to minimize token burn. Rotate through checks rather than running everything every time.
2. **Voice prompting** - Instead of constantly texting your agent, send voice notes, brain dumps, etc.
1. **Time audit** - Conduct a full time audit of your life - daily tasks, manual processes, etc. Create a spreadsheet with the data, share it with your OpenClaw agent, and prompt it to consult you on where it can help you automate.
